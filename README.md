# Fake News Classification
A system to identify unreliable news articles with deep learning.

### Installation
Install dependencies with ```pip```.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
To train a new model, simply run the following. A pre-trained model checkpoint is included with this repository.

```
python train.py
```

To convert the saved model checkpoint to a TensorFlow.js-compatible checkpoint for the in-browser demo, run:
```
tensorflowjs_converter --input_format keras save/model.h5 demo/tfjs
```

To try the model out, run:
```
python evaluate.py -a data/real.txt
```
To generate a ```submission.csv``` prediction file based on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news) ```test.csv``` data, simply run:
```
python evaluate.py
```

An in-browser TensorFlow.js version of the model is available [here](https://gmittal.github.io/fake-news/demo).

### Model
Below is the network architecture used for classification. It was trained on [data from the UTK Machine Learning Club](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data) available on Kaggle. **Achieves approximately 99% test accuracy** on both validation data and the [public Kaggle leaderboard](save/leaderboard.png) test data.
